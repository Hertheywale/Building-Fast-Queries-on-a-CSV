# Building-Fast-Queries-on-a-CSV
Designing a good algorithm depends on the context over which it will be used. Sometimes, memory is a high constraint and we have to sacrifice speed in order to be able to execute the algorithm. Other times, memory is not an issue and by preprocessing the data into an appropriate data structure, we can usually significantly increase the time complexity of an algorithm.
This is a project where i am going to implement some query functions to implement business questions for a laptop store.
This project also illustrates a common technique that can often be used to accelerate an algorithm. PREPROCESSING some of the input of an algorithm into a more suitable data structure is often a solution to improve the time complexity of an algorithm and make it run more efficiently.
This project was done using jupyter notebook
